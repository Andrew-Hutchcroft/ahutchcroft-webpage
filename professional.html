        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Andrew Hutchcroft and I am a senior studying Business Analytics & Information Systems (BAIS) and Management. I discovered a passion for BAIS through sports analytics, as I’ve always been a huge sports fan. Whether I was watching games on TV or attending them, I was constantly checking live statistics on my phone, looking for trends that could hint at the outcome of the game.</p>
      
        <p>This interest quickly evolved into deeper analysis, as I began studying coaching styles, season-wide stats, and per-game trends for individual college football teams. I decided to pair my BAIS major with Management because I wanted to learn how to effectively communicate the insights I found. It may not be the most common combination, but I believe it’s given me the unique ability to not only analyze data but also present it in a way that drives understanding and action.</p>
      
        <p>After graduation, I’ll be joining Ernst & Young in Des Moines, Iowa, working on their Technology Risk Assurance team starting in July. I’m excited to return, as I interned there last summer and had an amazing experience!</p>
      
        <p>Thanks for visiting my page—I hope it helps you get to know more about me, both personally and professionally!</p>
